A library for Arduino to make it easier to talk to Cosm (the service formerly known as Pachube).

The master copy of this code lives at http://github.com/cosm/cosm-arduino so make sure you're not looking at a branched copy elsewhere.

Requires the HTTP Client library in https://github.com/arduino/Arduino/pull/69 - which should be included in Arduino 1.0.1.
